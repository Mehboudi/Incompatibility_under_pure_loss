# Data for: "Measurement incompatibility under loss"
# Authors: Mohammad Mehboudi, Fatemeh Rezaeinia, and Saleh Rahimi-Keshari
#
# This file describes the contents of data.csv.
# The data corresponds to Table I in the manuscript. It provides the parameters
# for a set of n+1 measurements that are proven to remain incompatible
# under a loss channel with transmissivity tau_min.
#
# The data was generated via numerical simulation using semi-definite
# programming (SDP) to test for measurement incompatibility.
#
# COLUMNS in data.csv:
#
# 1. n: (integer)
#    The number of measurements in the set being made compatible by a loss
#    channel with transmissivity 1/n. 
#
# 2. r: (float)
#    The amplitude of the coherent states |mu_k> = r * exp[i*2*(k-1)*pi/(n+1)]
#    used in the construction of the on-off photodetection measurements.
#
# 3. tau_min: (float)
#    The minimum transmissivity of the loss channel under which the set of
#    n measurements remains incompatible. This value is calculated as
#    tau_min = (1/n) + epsilon, where the value of epsilon is found
#    numerically such that the set remains incompatible.
