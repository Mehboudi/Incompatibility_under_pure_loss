# Incompatibility_under_pure_loss
These codes are attached to our new draft entitled "Measurement incompatibility never breaks under pure loss". 
It will reproduce the results of Table 1.

We consider a set of n+1 measurements, based on displaced on-off photo-detection. We truncate to the d=2/3 dimensional subspace. And then we prove that the set are incompatible for the values of r described in the table. 
Thes values of r are not unique, we have found them by try and error, with the idea to minimise \tau_{\min} in the chart.

## How to run the codes

These codes are written in MATLAB.
